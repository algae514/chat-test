Final Design Document: Firebase-Integrated Chat Application

1. Overview

1.1 Purpose

This document outlines the design and development details for a test application that validates Firebase integration within a React Native chat application supported by a Java backend. The system is designed to handle user authentication, real-time messaging, file sharing, push notifications, and data archival with clearly defined responsibilities for each component.

1.2 High-Level Goals
	•	Robust Authentication: Implement phone-based authentication with token generation and management.
	•	Real-Time Chat: Leverage Firebase Firestore for real-time 1:1 and group chat, including status updates.
	•	Secure File Sharing: Use Firebase Storage for secure file uploads/downloads with client-side and server-side validations.
	•	Push Notifications: Utilize Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to deliver both transactional and bulk notifications.
	•	Data Archival: Automate archival of chat data to long-term storage (e.g., S3 buckets) with future provisions for manual overrides.
	•	Scalability & Security: Design the system to scale with user growth and enforce strict security policies at every level.
	•	Monitoring & Analytics (Future): Outline basic logging and monitoring strategies to be enhanced as the application scales.

2. System Architecture & Flow

2.1 Overall Architecture

The system is divided into three main components:
	•	Java Backend: Handles user and group management, token generation, file metadata management, system notifications, and data archival.
	•	Firebase: Manages real-time messaging (Firestore), file storage (Firebase Storage), push notifications (FCM), and presence tracking.
	•	React Native Test App: Acts as the client interface, validating authentication, messaging, file uploads/downloads, notifications, and overall UI responsiveness.

2.2 Detailed Flow
	1.	Authentication:
	•	Process:
	•	The user enters their phone number in the React Native app.
	•	The Java backend processes the phone number, performs necessary validations, and generates a Firebase token.
	•	The token is returned to the React Native app, which uses Firebase Authentication to sign in.
	•	Token Management:
	•	Currently, the plan is to re-trigger phone-based authentication on token expiration.
	•	Future Enhancement: Evaluate using Firebase’s built-in silent token refresh mechanism to improve user experience.
	2.	Messaging:
	•	Process:
	•	Once authenticated, the user can initiate real-time chats using Firebase Firestore.
	•	The app supports both 1:1 and group chats.
	•	Group Management:
	•	Group membership is controlled by the Java backend.
	•	Real-time updates (additions/removals) are pushed to the app via Firestore listeners.
	•	Multi-Device Synchronization:
	•	Current State: Not implemented.
	•	Recommendation: Design the data model with future multi-device sync in mind to ensure consistency across user devices.
	3.	File Sharing:
	•	Process:
	•	Users can select files (max 5MB) from their device.
	•	The React Native client performs a client-side check on file size.
	•	Files are then uploaded to Firebase Storage.
	•	Additional Validation: Complement client-side checks with Firebase Storage rules to enforce size limits.
	4.	Notifications:
	•	Process:
	•	FCM is used to send both bulk and transactional notifications.
	•	Testing:
	•	Initial tests can be conducted using the Firebase console.
	•	Future Work: Develop a test harness to simulate scenarios such as token refresh and notification delivery failures.
	5.	Data Archival:
	•	Process:
	•	Archival criteria are yet to be finalized (e.g., time-based such as messages older than 30/90 days).
	•	User-Specific: Individual archives may be pushed to user-specific S3 buckets.
	•	Group-Specific: Group chat archives may be stored in dedicated group S3 buckets.
	•	The process is designed to be fully automated with logs and alerts for monitoring.
